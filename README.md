# Places Around Me
## AIM:
To develop a website to display details about the places around my house.

## Design Steps:

### Step 1:
Open up a terminal in your preffered location, and start a django project using djang-admin startproject <your-project-name> Next setup an app inside the project folder using django-admin startapp <your-app-name>

### Step 2:
Once Created ,link your app to the project by adding it in the list of apps in settings.py file located inside the project folder. Add access to your host in allowed host setting and add static folders path to your settings.py file.

### Step 3:
Create a static folder and template folder and add all your required files for the project - Images .etc in your static folder. In the Template folder add your html files required for the pages.

### Step 4:
Head to the views.py in your app folder and create required functions to render a particular page or template when requested by the client. Next go to the urls.py and route the correct view functions to each particular request as needed.

### Step 5:
Next start the server from the projects main directory using python3 manage.py runserver 0:<portnumber>. Now the pages can be accessed from all the routed addresses in urls.py .

        The place is of full hygiene and hospital is very near for the people, this area is of central government employees township so area is maintained very clean and slient.there we have children enjoying parks and beach cool air. Schools and market are in walkable distance.
        Here all the facilities are provided by the DAE at good rates. One main positive things about my locality is that all the basic amenities like hospital, departmental stores, banks and park are available inside the township. Even during this pandemic time, we never felt any kind of problems and all sort of help was provided. We even have a beach inside the township which provides a refreshing environment after a long day in the office.

        Very beautiful beach. Long and reasonably clean. Best thing was the lack of crowds making it an attractive place. No intrusive vendors and litter.
The Kalpakam reactor in the background is the pride of India.
Road side parking available and short walk to beach.
The tree growth in background seems long and undisturbed adding to beauty of the beach.
Backwaters and beach meet here. It's the first time I ever saw that.
